                    Mr. Pop is my winning entry for the Polycount Quarterly Character Art Challenge. 
                    He was modeled based on a fantastic piece of concept art by Gaston Garcia. 
                    I wanted to follow the sillhouette of the concept, but push the realism of the character in the texturing and detailing.
                    The sugar flakes were procedurally generated using Maya's MASH tools.
